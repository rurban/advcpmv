## Advanced Copy/Move with progressbar ##

Advanced Copy is a mod for the GNU cp and GNU mv tools which adds a -g progress bar and provides some info on what's going on. It was written by Florian Zwicke and released under the GPL.

This repository exists because the [Advanced Copy](http://beatex.org/web/advancedcopy.html) website appears to be dead. You can still find it via the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20131115171331/http://beatex.org/web/advancedcopy.html).

advcpmv-0.5-8.21.patch was the last patch released by the author (on February 14, 2013). advcpmv-0.6-8.24.patch (and following) are simply a rebase of that on top of the 8.24 version of coreutils.

## Build instructions

The latest GNU Core Utilities source can be found here: https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/

```
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.30.tar.xz
tar xvJf coreutils-8.30.tar.xz
cd coreutils-8.30/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jarun/advcpmv/master/advcpmv-0.8-8.30.patch
patch -p0 -i advcpmv-0.8-8.30.patch
./configure
make
```

## Usage

### Change your behaviour

You can install the binaries and use `cpg -g` and `mvg -g` instead of cp and mv

```
sudo mv ./src/cp /usr/local/bin/cpg
sudo mv ./src/mv /usr/local/bin/mvg
```

### Alias

You can install the binaries and create aliases for bash (or whatever you use)

```
sudo mv ./src/cp /usr/local/bin/advcp
sudo mv ./src/mv /usr/local/bin/advmv
echo alias cp '/usr/local/bin/advcp -g' >> ~/.bashrc
echo alias mv '/usr/local/bin/advmv -g' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Upstream merge

I sent the patch to the team, that maintains the GNU CoreUtils. They won't merge this patch, because mv and cp are feature complete.
